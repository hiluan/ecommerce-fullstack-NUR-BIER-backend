## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Next.JS React.JS, Strapi, GraphQL, Cloudinary, Auth0, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Styled Component, Framer Motion, Heroku, Vercel, Stripe, Paypal

1. Frontend with Next.Js, Styled Components, Framer Motion, Toast:
- Next.Js: Javascript framework. 
- Styled Components: manages all CSS stylesheets.
- Framer Motion: helps create animated effects. 

2. Backend with Strapi (Node.Js), Cloudinary, Auth0, Stripe and Paypal APIs:
- Strapi: Clients can create/edit/delete their products on Strapi with its friendly UI for their convenience. Strapi then gives out an API to sync all products on the Web App.
- Cloudinary: every time a new product is created on Strapi, all of its photos will be automatically uploaded to Cloudinary. These photos will be optimized to different sizes: thumbnail, small, medium, large, etc. for our convenience. 
- GraphQl: uses query to pull out specific data from Strapi. 
- Auth0: works together with Strapi on the Backend to authenticate users' logins. Auth0 offers login for email, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  
- Stripe and Paypal APIs are for payments with Cards and Apple Pay, Google Pay integrated.

## Navigation and Pages:
1. Navigation Bar: 


Other than navigating from/to different pages on the site, there are 2 special buttons:
- Login / Sign Up: When clicking on it, the login page (from Auth0) will show up. After signing up and/or logging in, users can view their order histories by clicking on the same button which is now ‚ÄòMy Account.‚Äô
- Cart: Clicking on it will open the cart for customers to check the current state of their shopping bag.

2. Home Page:

- Chosen reviews of customers will be displayed here.

3. Product Page:

- Quantity is edited before adding to cart.

4. Checkout Page:
- Check out with Stripe: Payment methods can be varied from Credit/Debit Card to Apple/Google Pay. 
- Check out with Paypal: still under construction.

5. Login Page:
- Auth0 handles this page. It lets customers choose either to use their email or other services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

6. Other Pages: 
- Contact Page: Lets customers keep in touch with customer service.

## Optimizations
- Works well as a Mobile first / Responsive Website.
- Responsive CSS on iOS devices has problems with Parallax.
- Still in the testing phase. This section will be updated soon.

## Lessons Learned:
- Next.Js handles router-dom well.
- Payment with Stripe is colorful and there are many options to choose to put on customers' order histories or receipts. 
- Framer Motion is hard but pretty fun and it helps create beautiful effects on the website. 
- Working directly with clients is not easy. More communication should be made for both sides to understand each other.  
- Still in the testing phase. This section will be updated soon.
